# Fracture-Healing
Hypoxia activates Macrophages found in a fracture hematoma. They up regulate several genes to produce factors for angiogenesis/callus formation. Local pressure on the soft tissues surrounding the fracture likely creates local hypoxia. Hypoxia is a decrease in the amount of oxygen available to the soft tissues at levels compatible with tissue survival. The hypoxia is acting like a drug.
