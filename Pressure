# Fracture-Healing
Hypoxia activates Macrophages found in a fracture hematoma. They up regulate several genes to produce factors for angiogenesis/callus formation. Local pressure on the soft tissues surrounding the fracture likely creates local hypoxia. Hypoxia is a decrease in the amount of oxygen available to the soft tissues at levels compatible with tissue survival. The hypoxia is acting like a drug.

The Effect of Increased Tissue Pressure on Blood Flow

Abstract
Theoretical consideration of the factors involved in maintaining vascular equilibrium and experimental evidence in animals and man indicate that at high tissue pressures there may be a sharp decline in blood flow and, in certain situations, complete cessation of blood flow even at tissue pressures below mean arterial pressure. At least two mechanisms appear to be involved: active closure of small arterioles under vasomotor tone when transmural pressure is lowered, either by falls in intravascular pressure or rises in tissue pressure, and passive collapse of soft-walled capillaries when tissue pressure rises above intracapillary pressure. These mechanisms are likely to assume particular importance when tissues are surrounded by non-compliant fascia and may thus be involved in compartmental syndromes.
